__Program__

1. Takes one (1) argument (argv[1]): which port to listen to.
# use netstat to check for free ports  (select port between 5000 and 65536)

2. Main thread:
# begins program and starts listening to connection requests on the port.
# If it receives a connection request, it will open a new thread to handle it.

3. Worker thread:
# need a thread exclusive boolean to signal if thread should stay open or be closed.
# opens when it receives a new connect request.
# thread terminates once the connection is closed.

4. Temporary Database
# Hashtable (or hashmap technically?) of queues for collisions.
# How to make thread safe? lock each bucket.
# How to check if no other thread is writing?
# Need a reliable way to lock entire hashtable for resizing while also not preventing concurrent write and reads.
# > have to lock every bucket in the table before resizing
